The `cull-gmail` provides a software library and command line program to enable the culling of emails using the Gmail API.

- filtered lists of the contents
- move email matching a filtered list to trash
## cull-gmail Library Documentation

### Running the optional Gmail integration test

An optional, ignored integration test exercises the Gmail API end-to-end (networked). It is ignored by default and will not run in CI.

Steps to run locally:

1. Ensure you have valid OAuth client credentials configured for the library (see `ClientConfig::builder()` usage in docs).
2. Run the test explicitly with the ignored flag:

```bash
cargo test --test gmail_message_list_integration -- --ignored
```

Notes:
- The test performs a lightweight listing (max 10 messages) and should be safe, but it still uses your Gmail account.
- Do not run this in CI; it is intended only for local verification.

The `cull-gmail` library provides types to enable the culling of emails using the Gmail API including the following steps:
- login to get authorization
- backup the mailbox 
- filtered lists of the contents
- move email matching a filtered list to trash

### Installation
