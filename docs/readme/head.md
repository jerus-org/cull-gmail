The `cull-gmail` provides a software library and command line program to enable the culling of emails using the Gmail API.

## Quick Start

Get started with cull-gmail in minutes using the built-in setup command:

1. **Get OAuth2 credentials** from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. **Initialize cull-gmail** with guided setup:
   ```bash
   # Interactive setup (recommended)
   cull-gmail init --interactive --credential-file ~/Downloads/client_secret.json
   
   # Or preview first
   cull-gmail init --dry-run
   ```
3. **Verify your setup**:
   ```bash
   cull-gmail labels
   ```

## Main Features

- **Easy initialization**: Guided setup with OAuth2 credential validation and secure file handling
- **Flexible configuration**: Support for file-based config, environment variables, and ephemeral tokens
- **Safety first**: Dry-run mode by default, interactive confirmations, and timestamped backups
- **Label management**: List and inspect Gmail labels for rule planning
- **Message operations**: Query, filter, and perform batch operations on Gmail messages  
- **Rule-based automation**: Configure retention rules with time-based filtering and automated actions
- **Token portability**: Export/import OAuth2 tokens for containerized and CI/CD environments

### Running the optional Gmail integration test

An optional, ignored integration test exercises the Gmail API end-to-end (networked). It is ignored by default and will not run in CI.

Steps to run locally:

1. Ensure you have valid OAuth client credentials configured for the library (see `ClientConfig::builder()` usage in docs).
2. Run the test explicitly with the ignored flag:

```bash
cargo test --test gmail_message_list_integration -- --ignored
```

Notes:
- The test performs a lightweight listing (max 10 messages) and should be safe, but it still uses your Gmail account.
- Do not run this in CI; it is intended only for local verification.
